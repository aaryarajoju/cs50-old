//CS50-WEEK1-PSET1-CASH
/*"When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!).
Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms."
"Suppose that a cashier owes a customer some change and in that cashier’s drawer are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
The problem to be solved is to decide which coins and how many of each to hand to the customer.
Think of a “greedy” cashier as one who wants to take the biggest bite out of this problem as possible with each coin they take out of the drawer."*/
